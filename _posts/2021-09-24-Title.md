Hello, my name is Abderrahim Jami. I'm trying to create a website for my __portfolio__ ðŸ’»

---------------------------
This is a spacer not sure why I did that but I guess that's just me trying to get acquainted 
with using **markdown** syntax.
I haven't figured out how I'm going to structure my website but I do have some **portfolio examples** 
I'd like to use as a reference 

- [ ] [Phani Srikar](https://pikachuxxxx.github.io/ "Phani Srikar portfolio website")
- [ ] ... That's the only one I ended up saving despite having seen a lot more a couple of months ago. 
on behalf of my past self I do apologize 
- [ ] Look on the **Into Games** Discord Channel for more portfolio websites
